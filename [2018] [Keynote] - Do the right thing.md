# Abstract

Bad software not only causes problems for the current developers, but it will also be the cause of many headaches for future developers. This bad code may allow us to piece things together and get features out to our users, but in the long run this just isn’t sustainable. This technical debt can not only be the cause of broken releases, regressions and longer development times - but it can cause stress, anxiety and even burnout for the developers working on the project.

But it doesn’t have to be like that. As developers we have the responsibility to be professional with the code we write to ensure that we not only satisfy the needs of our users, but we also satisfy the needs of our developers. Doing the right thing means we can be both empathetic during development and keep our project maintainable at the same time.
