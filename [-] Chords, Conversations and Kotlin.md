# Abstract

Conversational tools allow us to create experiences which are not only more inclusive, but also bridge the gap between the digital and physical world. Whether it's an assistive smart guitar that helps make learning guitar more accessible, 
a conversational bot to act as an assistance tool or a companion tool for an existing product - there are plenty of uses for conversational tools that can help to improve experiences for many.

In this talk I want to show you how we can make use of the Actions on Google Kotlin library to create the conversational logic for these products. We'll take a tour of the client library, explore the possibilites of what can be achieved and walk through the creation of a conversational tool - giving you enough to knowledge to be able to create these experiences for yourself.
