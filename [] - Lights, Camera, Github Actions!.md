# Abstract

Continuous Integration (CI) helps many companies increase the stability of their products and productivity of their developers throughout the development lifecycle. When it comes to CI services we can often get tied in with third-party tools that not only require a lot of context switching but can become expensive to pay over time. What if we could run these same CI processes in the same place that our code is being hosted?

In this talk we'll be learning how we can run our unit tests, UI tests, lint checks, APK builds, release processes and more all from within GitHub using Github Actions. With this knowledge you'll leave this talk with actionable steps to be able to add these same processes for your own projects within Github and centralise the workflow for your project!
