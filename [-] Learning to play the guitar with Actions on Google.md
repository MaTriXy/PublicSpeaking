# Abstract

Actions on Google is a fascinating platform that allows us to create conversational experiences. These experiences can cater for many use cases, allowing us to build conversation tools using both audio and visual means - allowing us to create interactions which are accessible to many users with different needs.

In this session, weâ€™ll be exploring the Actions on Google platform, the components available to use in the Actions SDK and how we can use Dialogflow to learn how we can create a conversational guitar tutor for Google Actions.
