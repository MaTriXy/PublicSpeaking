# Title

Tensorflow for mobile developers

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract

Machine Learning can be a challenging subject, but luckily for us we have a powerful tool called TensorFlow to lend us a hand. And I believe that soon, machine learning will become an essential part of the development toolkit - so there is no better time to get started on learning what we can do with it. 

In this talk I want to introduce you to machine learning and explore some of the fundamental ideas around TensorFlow. We'll  be looking at how we can retrain and use TensorFlow models, inspect them using the TensorFlow TensorBoard and how this can all tie in with our existing Android experience.
