# Abstract

Is it that time already?! It feels like not so long ago we were getting our apps ready to support android P - now it's that time to do the same for the next Android release, Q.

Android Q bring a collection of behavior changes that will be required by all applications, whilst also bringing us some new features and functionality that applications will be able to utilize. In this talk we'll explore what changes with Android Q and the new functionalities it introduces, along with how we can implement these changes into our own applications.
