Getting clean, keeping lean

45 minute talk

# Abstract

Whilst crafting products, it’s common for developers to find difficult to ship products and fast whilst also creating a codebase that allows you to easily do so. Whilst at the beginning of a project lifecycle you are free and able to move quick, it’s the technical debt build up that will make it hard for both you and future developers to move fast and maintain your codebase. Clean Architecture allows you to create a codebase that is both easy to maintain and extend, whilst also opening up the ability to thoroughly test each layer of your codebase.

Following Clean Architecture has made me discover the advantages that it can bring our projects. Coupled with the following of SOLID principles, codebases can not only become cleaner and well tested, but they can move in a direction that allows us move fast whilst remaining easy to work with at the same time. In this talk, we’ll be looking at what clean architecture is, why we should bring it on board and how we won’t be looking back.
