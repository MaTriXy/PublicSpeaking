# Public Speaking
A collection of my abstracts and other stuff related to public speaking. Each document contains the talk **title**, **type** (e.g. keynote), **abstract**, **submitted to** and **given at** sections.

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** to be talking about. Want me to speak about something here? Get in touch with me over on twitter @hitherejoe :)

# Key for file titles

- R: Rejected and never given at a conference
- ~R: Rejected because a different submission to the same conference was accepted
- A: This talk was accepted and given at the listed conferences
- I: Invited, written specifically for the given conference
- -: None of the above yet, still pending approval / rejection

# Speaking timeline
