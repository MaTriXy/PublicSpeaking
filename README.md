# Public Speaking
A collection of my abstracts and other stuff related to public speaking. Each document contains the talk **title**, **type** (e.g. keynote), **abstract**, **submitted to** and **given at** sections.

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** to be talking about. Want me to speak about something here? Get in touch with me over on twitter @hitherejoe :)
