# Public Speaking
A collection of my abstracts and other stuff related to public speaking. Each document contains the talk **title**, **type** (e.g. keynote), **abstract**, **submitted to** and **given at** sections.

These are all things I **have**, **want** and **am going** (well, I plan on!) to be talking about. Want me to speak about something here? Get in touch with me over on twitter [@hitherejoe](https://twitter.com/hitherejoe) :)

# Key for file titles

- R: Rejected and never given at a conference
- ~R: Rejected because a different submission to the same conference was accepted
- A: This talk was accepted and given at the listed conferences
- I: Invited, written specifically for a given conference
- -: These will be talks which I am looking to give but are still pending submission /approval / rejection

# Speaker Bio

Hi, my names Joe. I’m an Android Engineer and Google Developer Expert for Android, Assistant, Google Pay and Flutter based in Brighton, UK working on the Android team at Buffer. I’m passionate about coding and love creating robust, polished and exciting projects for mobile, the web, TV, wearables and I’ll probably be toying with whatever the new thing is at the time you’re reading this – I love to be constantly learning. I’m also a keen writer as I love to share my learnings and experiences with others.
