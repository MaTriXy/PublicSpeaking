# Title  

Building apps with Kotlin Multiplatform

# Type  

45 minute talk  

# Abstract  

When it comes to how we currently build native mobile applications, it feels like there's a lot of repetition as we move across our teams. We build the same features across our Android and iOS platforms and write almost identical code during implementation. We want to keep our mobile experiences native, so sharing code has always been a difficult option.

In this talk I want to show you how we can overcome this with Kotlin multiplatform. We'll dive into what kotlin multiplatform is
and how we can use it to build mobile applications that share core parts of our mobile features, whilst still allowing our users to enjoy the native experience that they are familiar with. You'll not only leave this talk with knowledge on how to start integrating kotlin multiplatform, but be inspired and hopeful that we can collaborate even better when it comes to mobile teams.
