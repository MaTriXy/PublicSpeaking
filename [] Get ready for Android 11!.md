# Abstract

Is it that time already?! It feels like not so long ago we were getting our apps ready to support android 10 - now it's that time to do the same for the next Android release, 11.

Android 11 brings a collection of behavior changes that will be required by all applications, whilst also bringing us some new features and functionality that applications will be able to utilize. 
In this talk we'll explore what changes with Android 11 and the new functionalities it introduces, along with how we can implement these changes into our own applications to ensure we're ready to 
support the latest and greatest from Day 1!
