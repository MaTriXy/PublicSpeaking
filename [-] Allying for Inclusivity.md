Allying for Inclusivity

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract

I've previously been scared to be speak up in situations where I could have made change, likely from fear of saying the 
wrong thing and worsening the sitation. But if we never take action, how can we make change? 

In todays workplaces, there are still huge issues with inclusivity. Whilst you may not notice it in your workplace,
underrepresented groups are faced with difficulties and feelings that us with privilege are likely to have never encountered.
But this doesn't and shouldn't, have to be the way - being an ally allows us to amplify the voices of the underrepresented 
and make change happen. And in this talk, I'd to share with you some of my learnings around how we can be better allies for inclusivity and 
make improvements not only in our place of work, but in our every day lives.
