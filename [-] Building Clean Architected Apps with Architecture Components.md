# Title

Building Clean Architected Apps with Architecture Components

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract

Clean architecture is a powerful concept that allows us to build maintainable, extendable and thoroughly testable applications. Not only does it create a clear separation of concerns, but this concept can be pushed further by modularising our applications to easily enforce this principle. 

In this talk, we’ll be looking at how we’ve built our latest Android app at Buffer using clean architecture coupled with architecture components (lifecycle aware components & Room). We’ll be covering how we can utilise this combination to create a well structured, modularised application. And to top it off, we’ll also be learning about the benefits of working in this way and with how we apply testing to all the parts of our app in this new architectural approach.
