# Abstract

The way in which we structure our android applications had never really changed, up until now. With the concepts of bundles and modularization there are new ways to structure our applications that not only help us to better organize our code, but also take advantage of new distribution features from Google Play - allowing us deliver more optimised and personalised experiences to our users with ease.

In this talk I want to dive into the concept of app bundles and modularisationm and give you the confidence to be able to implement these practices into your own applications. We'll learn the different approaches for how we can modularise our android applications, how app bundles work and the advantages that come from these two concepts coming together.
