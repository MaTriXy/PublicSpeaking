# Abstract

The way in which we structure our android applications had never really changed, up until now. With the concepts of bundles and modularization there are new ways to structure our applications that not only help us to better organize our code, but also take advantage of new distribution features from Google Play - allowing us deliver more optimised and personalised experiences to our users with ease. At Buffer we've always been big fans of modularising our application and we've recently started to shift towards feature modularisation, making use of the new dynamic feature modules.

Along this journey we've had a lot of learnings, ones which I would love to share with you! In this talk I want to dive into the concept of app bundles and modularisation, giving you the confidence to be able to implement these practices into your own applications. We'll learn the different approaches for how we can modularise our android applications, how app bundles work and the advantages that come from these two concepts coming together.
