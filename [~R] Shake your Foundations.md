Shake your Foundations

45 minute talk

# Abstract

MVP? MVVM? MVI? Clean Architecture? In a world with so many different ways to build something how do we keep up, let alone know what one we should use. With all these choices, it can be easy to start off on the wrong foot or be put off of from exploring other options from what we are used to working with.

In this talk I want to explore the different options we have when building the foundations of our android projects. Iâ€™m not looking to make you a software architect, but having an understanding of each of these, along with the benefits each can bring, can help you and your team to make the right decisions for the project you are creating to ensure a smoother project lifecycle.
