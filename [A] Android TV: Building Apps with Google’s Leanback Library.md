Android TV: Building Apps with Googleâ€™s Leanback Library 

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract

In this class, we'll look at how we can create Android TV apps with the help of Google's leanback library. After a brief introduction to the TV platform and an open-source Vine TV app, we'll move straight into how you can begin building applications for yourself using the leanback library, following best practices along the way. We'll take a look at the different components that are provided by the framework and how you can craft custom components of your own to enhance your application's UX. Seeing as Android TV applications are completely testable, we'll also take a brief look at how this can be done to ensure your app functions as expected!
