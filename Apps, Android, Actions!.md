# Abstract


Over the past few years, voice technology has been becoming more present in our day to day tasks. With the direction in which new technology announcements have been focused in, this is only going to become more apparent in the things that we build and interact with. Not only does this help to streamline our users experiences with our applications, but it also makes the things we build far more accessible with the use of voice technology - all of which can be introduced via the use of App Actions for Android.

In this talk we'll explore these App Actions and what they can for our applications. We'll take a deep dive to learn exactly what they, how they work and how they can be implemented to provide frictionless, voice-powered interactions within our applications.
