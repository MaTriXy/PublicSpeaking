Testing? Ain’t nobody got time for that!

# Abstract

“I don’t have time to write tests”, “My code works, I don’t need to test it”, “I’ll write the tests later” - I’m sure we’ve all heard at least one these before!  These are all unfortunately commonly heard phrases when it comes to testing. But we’re only human, and no matter how skilled of a developer you are, testing is essential to ensure your product remains stable and maintainable throughout its lifetime. Luckily for us, the Android ecosystem provides a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy for us to test the multiple layers of our application.

In this talk, I want to explore with you the importance of the testing of our applications, in the form of both Unit and UI testing, along with the tools and practices we can use to help us achieve. I’ll be sharing our own experiences at Buffer of going from 0 tests to a well-tested codebase and we’ll be looking at how we can write and structure maintainable tests for our own applications using both jUnit & espresso.
