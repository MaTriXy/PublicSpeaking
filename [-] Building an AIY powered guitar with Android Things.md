Building an AIY powered guitar with Android Things

45 minute talk

# Abstract

Since Android Things was announced we've seen so many fascinating side projects from within the community. The hurdle which I've always faced however is, how can we apply these to real-world every day products which we use?
That's why I decided to build a guitar with a built in tutor, powered by Android Things. Using Andorid Things and AIY project kits we can build tools to create a more convenient and personalised experience, as well as bring
possibilities to those who may not usually be able to accomplish them. 

In this talk I want to explore how we can build projects for android things that can actually have an impact in the real world, starting in musical form! We'll look at how we can build projects using the platform and mix it 
up with AIY kits to create practical AI powered projects with Android.
