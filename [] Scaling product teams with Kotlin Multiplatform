# Title

Scaling product teams with Kotlin Multiplatform

# Type

30-45 minute talk

# Abstract

When we think about the products our business offers, how many of those are shipped across multiple platforms? Whilst there are tools and frameworks
available that allow us to write-once and run-anywhere, the solutions offered by these often hit limitations when implementing
product work. Kotlin Mutliplatform is an emerging solution that allows the sharing the core logic of our applications, whilst still
natively implementing user interfaces on each platform indepentently.

In this talk I want to share how Kotlin multiplatform helps us to focus on the goals of our business - not only help to make each of our 
product teams more productive, but allowing us to spend more time focusing on the user facing parts of our products.
