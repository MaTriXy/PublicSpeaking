# Abstract

In this modern day we often take things for granted. From the apps we use, the things we buy to the clothes we wear - 
it's easy to get wrapped up in our consumption and forget how easy it is for us to interact with these things. Now imagine 
if there was a change of circumstance - would you still be able to interact with the device that you're reading 
this on? How would your experience have been getting to the location that you're currently at, or brew that coffee you
made this morning?

Without being in these positions ourselves, it can be too easy to make things that might work well for us, but not necessairly 
be usable by those who are not in the same position. In this talk I want to explore this mindset so that we can think outside
of our comfort zone, in the hope that more people can be enabled to explore the things that we experience.
