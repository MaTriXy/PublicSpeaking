Abstract
Fed up of code that's difficult to refactor? Tired of code smells? Tired of working with messy software architecture? Having personally worked with legacy code in both the present and the past, I began to understand how important it is to alleviate these pains. Luckily for you there are five principles of object-orientated design that can help us to craft software that is both easy to maintain and extend, these principles are known together as SOLID.

In this talk we'll look at what makes up the SOLID acronym and what each principle means for our code - followed by how we can use these principles to improve both the code we maintain and also code we write in the future. There have been numerous opportunities to apply these principles when both refactoring and rewriting parts of projects since learning about the principles. So from this we'll be looking at real world examples to help us understand how the different aspects of SOLID can be implemented into our own projects to create the same result of a better crafting system.

By the end of this talk, we'll be more familiar with the concepts of SOLID and how we can use the approach during development to write more maintainable and extensible code.
