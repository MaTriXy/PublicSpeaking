# Title

Wellbeing Driven Development: Keeping our developers & projects healthy

# Type

Keynote / Talk

# Abstract

The products we build have a long lifespan both before and after they reach our users. The code they're made up of has a big story to tell -
often it can be one of bugs, crashes, stress, conflict or even burnout. But with the right tools and practices in place we can shape
our development process to be one of calm, focus and wellbeing. In this talk I want to explore the whys and hows of how we can
keep both our developers and projects in a healthy state, allowing us to fast and stress free.
