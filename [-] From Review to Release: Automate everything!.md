# Title

From Review to Release: Automate everything!

# Type

45 minute talk

# Abstract

From code to release, the android team at Buffer has always had a manual process in place. Whilst all of the tasks that make up the development lifecycle are not individually trivial, added together these can add a lot of cognitive lode and knowledge silo to our process.

This year at Buffer we've been slowly adding automated steps to our workflow, moving us towards a truely automated Continuos Delivery workflow. From code review to scheduled releases, in this talk I want to share with you both why and how we've automated our entire workflow so that you can too.
