# Abstract

When it comes to the development-to-release lifecycle for mobile applications, it can look very different to what we see for our web applications.
Updates to our mobile apps not only require uploading, processing and then downloading by our users, but we also see an approval time of upto 3 days per update that is released. 
Alongside this, app store reviews & ratings can haunt applications for a long period of time - so with such a stretched release process we need to do our best to ensure that
what we ship does not greatly decrease the experience for our users.

However, with sufficient mobile DevOps practices in place, we can optimise this lifecycle to help increase both the quality and confidence
in the releases that we are shipping. Naturally these practices also bring us many steps of automation within our workflows, offloading these
responsibilites from specific team members and opening opportunities for us to streamline our development-to-release lifecycle. In this talk we'll
explore some personal learnings and real world examples of mobile devops workflows so that your teams can explore these concepts for themselves!
