# Abstract

Since Material Design has been introduced to the world of Android, many applications are still not making the most out of what's provided to us out-of-the-box to help us create material styled apps. In this class, we'll take a look at the capabilities of the design support library and how we can implement the numerous components that it provides to help us create beautiful and polished material influenced applications. As well as taking a deep dive into these components and their various attributes, we'll also take a look at how you can add subtle animations to compliment your material apps even further!
