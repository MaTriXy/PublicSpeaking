Building an accessible smart guitar for the deaf, blind and mute

45 minute talk

# Abstract

I've always loved playing guitar - but I feel it's something that I've always taken for granted. Whilst I was able to pick up a guitar
and start teaching myself how to play, that experience might not be the same for everyone. That's why I decided to build a smart, accessible
guitar that would allow others to experience the joy of music with less of hurdle to do so.

Powered by Actions on Google, Firebase, Dialogflow and Google Cloud - the Chord Assist smart guitar allows people who are blind, deaf 
or mute to be able to learn, play and tune their guitar. In this talk I want to share the journey of this project - from the importance
of inclusive craft to how all these technologies come together to provide an accessible experience for everyone.
